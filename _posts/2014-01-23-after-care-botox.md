Have you received botox or xeomin? Follow these simple instructions to look your best for months to come.

Be assured that any tiny bumps or marks will go away within a few hours. If you need to apply make-up within 4  hours after treatment, only use a gentle touch to avoid rubbing the treated area.

Do not rub or massage the treated area for 2 hours after your treatment. Do not do strenuous exercise for 4 hours after treatment. Also avoid facials or saunas for 4 hours after treatment. This will minimize the risk of temporary bruising. Feel free to shower and go about most other regular daily activities.

Do not lie down for 4 hours after treatment. This is to avoid the risk of pressure on the treated areas (from your pillow) and to avoid the risk of having the area rubbed accidentally.

If you had Botox/Xeomin on or around the nose, do not wear glasses for 4 hours.

Remember that results of your treatment may take up to 14 days to take full effect. Please wait until the 14 days has passed before assesing if you are pleased with the results.  Usually this 2 week period is followed by a follow up assesment with the doctor.

Botox or Xeomin in accordance with the reccomendations listed above will have you looking and feeling younger than ever!
