The Obagi clenziderm system is the only prescription-strength acne treatment that contains a patented, solubilized form of 5% benzoyl peroxide (BPO) to penetrate deep into the skin and treat acne where it starts. We expect to deal with acne when we're younger but recent studies show that adult acne occurs in greater than 1 in 5 of women ages 31-40 and greater than 1 in 10 in woman 41-50. For more information on treating acne give us a call; the Clenziderm system may be what you are looking for.
