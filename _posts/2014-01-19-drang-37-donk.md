>Speed provides the one genuinely modern pleasure. <cite>-Aldous Huxley</cite>

Length: 37"

Width: 10.25"

Wheel base:  29.25- 30.75"

Materials: 9 plies of Hard Maple is used in our standard Downhill Layups.  Deep hand routed and sanded wheel wells allow riders to take advantage of the enlightened feel of the deck, by running no riser or shock pads, and in most cases, even with low trucks and 72mm wheels, full lean will be achieved before wheel bite occurs.  This is the case with almost all of our concave options, specially those with raised wheel well flairs, or lenticular concave (which is basically a gradual yet tall flair which transitions all the way from the middle of the deck to the 27.5" EFP mark.)
