Have you received fillers? Follow these simple instructions to look your best for months to come.

First of all, swelling and bruising after treatment is normal and can last 7 to 14 days. Cold compresses applied immediately may reduce swelling.

Avoid rubbing, touching and pressure to the treated area for 6 hours following augmentation.

Avoid over exposure to sun and cold outdoor acivities until redness associated with augmentation disappears.

Avoid alcohol and exercise for 6 hours folowing augmentation, and try to sleep on your back for the first two nights.

To minimize bruising and swelling, Arnica Montana 30 is usually recommended for one week prior and one week after treatment.

Juvedem, Radiesse, and Belotero in accordance with the reccomendations listed above will have you looking and feeling younger than ever!
