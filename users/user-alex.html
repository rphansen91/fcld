about: Greetings all, my name is Alexandra but my friends call me Alex. I am a single mom to one 20 year old son and one beautiful 17 year old daughter and a couple of four legged kids too (At least it feels like it). I am a member of Calvary Chapel Worship Center and in my spare time I enjoy everything that revolves around our amazing sandy beaches. When it comes to sports it's all about the baseball - Go Rays!
