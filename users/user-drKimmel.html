name: David A Kimmel
rank: DMD
about: I entered the field of Clinical Microbiology, working for 9 years at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. During this time I started graduate school and really enjoyed doing basic research. My graduate advisor taught Biochemistry at the University of Kentucky Dental school. It was under his influence that I applied to dental school so I could continue my research.</br></br>I graduated in 1989, from the University of Louisville Dental School, and on the day of my graduation my mother had a secret to tell me. Seems when I was 5 years old, I told her that when I grew up I wanted to be a dentist! Mom thought it was destiny, I thought it was because the dentist had a great Treasure Chest and we always got a free toy every time we went! Mom may have been right as I do love what I do every day but I also have a Treasure Chest full of toys in my office!
